There is some inaccuracy for me here:
Acceptance criteria says that "Users are able to create only one Study Group for a single Subject" but also "Users can also filter Study Groups by a given Subject".
According to that there should not be more then one group per subject if I correctly understood that.



Positive Test Cases for Study Group Feature:

1. Test Case: Creating a Study Group Successfully
Description: Verify that a study group can be created successfully with valid inputs.
Steps:
User initiates creation of a study group.
User provides a name for the study group (between 5-30 characters).
User selects a valid subject (Math, Chemistry, or Physics).
User submits the creation request.
Inputs:
Name: "Chemistry group (random id)"
Study Group ID: random for automation
